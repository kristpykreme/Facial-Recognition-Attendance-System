# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System
Personal project for a friend; AI facial recognition attendance GUI using Python libraries tkinter for the app and opencv for the trainer.
Create a file name 'dataset' to store the pictures and 'trainer' to store the trained dataset in the same directory. In the demo, I combined all .py files into an .exe file. I also stored the pictures used for the app in the 'lib' file.
