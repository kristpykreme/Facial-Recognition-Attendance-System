# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System
Personal project for a friend; AI facial recognition attendance system using Python libraries tkinter for the app and opencv for the trainer.
Create a file name 'dataset' to store the pictures and 'trainer' to store the trained dataset in the same directory. In the demo, I combined all .py files into an .exe file. I also added an attendance sheet in a form of an excel file under 'lib' file.
